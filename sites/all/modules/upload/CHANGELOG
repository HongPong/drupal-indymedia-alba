This is a wee changelog of indymedia alba hacks on the core drupal upload
module, made to facilitate better integration between drupal's file upload
and fckeditor image insertion. We generate thumbnails and provide a way
of inserting attached images into the fckeditor WYSIWYG control.

Made 'Insert an image from another article' only show images for current
revision id (vid) of nodes, so as not to duplicate results when an article
has a number of revisions.

Made 'Insert an image from another article' link have nice pointy-hand cursor.
